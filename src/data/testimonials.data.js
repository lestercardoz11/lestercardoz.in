      'Lester has been an exceptional leader for our ServiceNow division, which has been achieving remarkable growth of 100% quarter-over-quarter. Even with such explosive expansion, last quarter saw the fewest escalations since the division`s inception in mid-2023-a testament to his effective leadership. Leading a young team while managing numerous projects is no small feat, especially for someone who stepped into a managerial role just a year ago. Yet, Lester handles it all with impressive composure, making it seem effortless. His ability to balance team coaching, project delivery, and growth management is truly commendable and has been instrumental to the division`s success.',
